Hello, my name is Mark Garcia!

I'm a Media arts and animation major and a artist at heart. Specifically for less traditional art.
My initial thought of what Technical writing was the in's and out's of th process of writing. Like what goes into the mindset and the parts of a paragraph.
Honestly, knowing what it is now makes a lot more sense than whatever I thought it was. The writing of technical and instructional/educational works is a lot more useful than knowing the structure of an essay or the sorts.
