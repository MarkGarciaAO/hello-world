Hello, my name is Mark Garcia!

I'm a Media arts and animation major and a artist at heart. Specifically for less traditional art.
I started going to the Art institute of Seattle for Animation, stayed there for about 3 quarters. Funny thing is on my first week of school
there was I got struck by a truck during the first week; truely setting the tone of how I'd last there. After a long, grueling 3 quarters,I decided to transfer to Pierce.
My initial thought of what Technical writing was the in's and out's of th process of writing. Like what goes into the mindset and the parts of a paragraph.
Honestly, knowing what it is now makes a lot more sense than whatever I thought it was. The writing of technical and instructional/educational works is a lot more useful than knowing the structure of an essay or the sorts.
